# OcuLED
Monitor PC status (now playing, performance) on a monochrome OLED LCD connected to a WS8211. The program is controlled via any keyboard
(e.g. a [Pikatea Macropad](https://www.pikatea.com/products/pikatea-macropad-fk1)).

Some of the performance statistics require openhardwaremonitor to be running on the computer.
